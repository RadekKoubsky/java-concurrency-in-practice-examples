     * The "testLeak" method inserts several large objects into a bounded buffer and then
     * removes them; memory usage at heap snapshot #2 should be approximately the same as
     * at heap snapshot #1. On the other hand, if the "doExtract" method forgot to null

     * usage at the two snapshots would definitely not be the same. (This is one of the few
