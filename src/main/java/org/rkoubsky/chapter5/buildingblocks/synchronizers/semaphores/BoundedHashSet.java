/**
 * Using Semaphore to bound a collection
 *
 * Counting semaphores are used to control the number of activities
 * that can access a certain resource or perform a given action at
 * the same time.
 *
 * Counting semaphores can be used to implement resource pools (database connection pool)
 * or to impose a bound on a collection.
 *
 * <NOTE_permit_objects>
 *
 *     The implementation has no actual permit objects, and Semaphore
 *     does not associate dispensed permits with treads, so a permit
 *     acquired in one thread can be released from another thread.
 *
 *     You can think of "acquire" as consuming a permit and "release" as
 *     creating one; a Semaphore is not limited to the number of permits
 *     it was created with.
 *
 * </NOTE_permit_objects>
 *
 * <NOTE_binary_semaphore>
 *
 *     A degenerate case of a counting semaphore is a binary Semaphore;
 *     a Semaphore with an initial count to one. A binary semaphore can
 *     be used as mutex with nonreentrant locking semantics; whoever holds
 *     the sole permit holds the mutex.
 *
