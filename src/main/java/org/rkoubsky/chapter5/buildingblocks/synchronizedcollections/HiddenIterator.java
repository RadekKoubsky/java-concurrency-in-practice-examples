         * The string concatenation gets turned by the compiler into a call to
         * StringBuilder.append(Object), which in turn invokes the collection's
         * toString method - and the implementation of toString in the standard
         * collections iterates the collection, thus may throw ConcurrentModificationException
         *
         * Of course, the real problem is that HiddenIterator is not thread-safe;
         * the HiddenIterator lock (this) should be acquired before using the "set"
         * field in "println" call, but debugging and logging code commonly neglect to do this.
         *
         * The real reason here is that the greater the distance between the state and the
         * synchronization that guards it, the more likely that someone will forget to use proper
         * synchronization when accessing that state.
