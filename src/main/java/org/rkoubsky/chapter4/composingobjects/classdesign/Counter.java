/**
 * Simple thread-safe counter using the Java monitor pattern
 *
 * <NOTE_thread_safe_class_design>
 *
 * The design process of a thread-safe class should include these three basic elements:
 *
 * 1. Identify the variables that form the object's state.
 * 2. Identify the invariants that constrain the state variables.
 * 3. Establish a policy for managing concurrent access to the object's state.
 *
 * </NOTE_thread_safe_class_design>
 *
 *
 * <NOTE_object_state>
 *
 * An object's state starts with fields:
 *
 * If fields are all of primitive type, the fields comprise the entire state.
 *
 * If the object has fields that are references to other objects, its state will
 * encompass fields from the referenced objects as well.
 *
 * This Counter class has only one field, so the "value" field comprises its entire state.
 *
 * </NOTE_object_state>
 *
 * <NOTE_thread_safety_vs_invariants>
 *
 * You cannot ensure thread-safety without understanding an object's invariants and
 * postconditions. Constraints on the valid values or state transitions for state variables
 * can create atomicity and encapsulation requirements.
 *
 * When multiple variables participate in an invariant, the lock that guards them must be held
 * for the duration of any operation that accesses related variables.
 *
 * </NOTE_thread_safety_vs_invariants>
