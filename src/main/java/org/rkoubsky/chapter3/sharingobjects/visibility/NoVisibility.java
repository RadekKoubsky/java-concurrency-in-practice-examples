/**
 * Sharing variables without synchronization. Don't do this.
 *
 * In general, there is no guarantee that the reading thread will see a value written by another
 * thread on a timely basis, or not at all.
 *
 * <NOTE_reordering>
 *
 * There is no guarantee that operations in one thread will be performed in the order given by the
 * program, as long as the reordering is not detectable from within that thread - even if the
 * reordering is not apparent to other threads.
 *
 * Reordering allows JVMs to take full advantage of the performance of multiprocessor hardware.
 *
 * </NOTE_reordering>
 *
 * NOTE: In absence of synchronization, the compiler, processor, and runtime can do some downright weird
 * things to the order in which operations appear to execute.
 *
 * TO AVOID THESE COMPLEX ISSUES: Always use the proper synchronization whenever data is shared across threads.
