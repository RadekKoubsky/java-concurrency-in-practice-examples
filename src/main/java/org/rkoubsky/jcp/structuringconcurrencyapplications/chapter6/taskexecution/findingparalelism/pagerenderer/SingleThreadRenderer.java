/**
 * Rendering page elements sequentially
 *
 * SingleThreadRenderer takes still sequential approach that
 * involves rendering the text elements first, leaving
 * rectangular placeholders for the images, and after
 * completing the initial pass on the document, going
 * back and downloading the images and drawing them into
 * associated placeholders.
 *
 * Downloading an image involves waiting for I/O to complete, and
 * during this time the CPU does little work.Se the sequential approach
 * may under-utilize CPU, and also makes the user wait longer than
 * necessary to see the finished page. We can achieve better
 * utilization and responsiveness by breaking the problem into
 * independent tasks that can execute concurrently.
