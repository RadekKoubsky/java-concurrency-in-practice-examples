/**
 * Task that deadlocks in a single-threaded Executor. Don't do this.
 *
 * ThreadDeadLock illustrates thread starvation deadlock.
 * RenderPageTask submits two additional tasks to the Executor to
 * fetch the page header and footer, renders the page body, waits
 * for the results of header and footer tasks, and then combines
 * the header, body, and footer into the finished page.
 *
 * With a SingleThreadedExecutor, ThreadDeadLock will always deadlock.
 *
 * <NOTE_starvation_deadlock>
 *
 *     Thread starvation deadlock can occur whenever a pool task initiates
 *     an unbounded blocking wait for some resource or condition that can
 *     succeed only through the action of another pool task, such as waiting
 *     for the return value or side effect of another task, unless you can
 *     guarantee that the pool is large enough.
 *
 *     In a single-threaded executor, a task that submits another task to
 *     the same executor and waits for its result will always deadlock.
 *
 * </NOTE_starvation_deadlock>
 *
 * <NOTE_implicit_coupling_between_task_and_execution_policies>
 *
 *     While the Executor framework offers substantial flexibility
 *     in specifying and modifying execution policies, not all tasks
 *     are compatible with all execution policies.
 *
 *     Types of tasks that require specific execution policies include:
 *
 *     [Dependent tasks]
 *     The most well behaved tasks are independent: those that do not
 *     depend on timing, results, or side effects of other tasks.
 *
 *     On the other hand, when you submit tasks that depend on other tasks
 *     in a thread pool, you implicitly create constraints on the execution
 *     policy that must be carefully managed to avoid liveness problems
 *
 *     [Tasks that exploit thread confinement]
 *     Objects can be confined to the task thread, thus enabling
 *     tasks designed to run in that thread to access those objects
 *     without synchronization, even if the resources are not thread-safe.
 *     This forms an implicit coupling between the task and the execution
 *     policy - the tasks require their executor to be single-threaded.
 *
 *     [Response-time-sensitive tasks]
 *     GUI applications are sensitive to response time. E.g. submitting
 *     a long running task to a single-threaded executor may impair the
 *     responsiveness of the service managed by the Executor.
 *
 *     [Tasks that use ThreadLocal]
 *     ThreadLocal makes sense to use in pool threads only if the thread-local
 *     value has lifetime that is bounded by that of a task; ThreadLocal should
 *     not be used in pool threads to communicate values between tasks.
 *
