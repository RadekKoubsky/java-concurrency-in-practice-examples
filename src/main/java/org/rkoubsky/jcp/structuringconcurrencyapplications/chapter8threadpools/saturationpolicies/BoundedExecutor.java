/**
 * Using a Semaphore to throttle task submission
 *
 * There is no predefined saturation policy in default implementations of
 * link {@link java.util.concurrent.RejectedExecutionHandler} to make
 * the "execute" method block when the work queue is full.
 *
 * However, the same effect can be accomplished by using a Semaphore to bound
 * the task injection rate.
 *
 * In this approach, use an unbounded queue (there's no reason to bound both
 * the queue size and injection rate) and set the bound on the semaphore to
 * be equal to the pool size plus the number of queued tasks you want to allow,
 * since the semaphore is bounding the number of tasks both currently executing
 * and awaiting execution.
