/**
 * Using a volatile field to hold cancellation state
 *
 * There is no safe way to preemptively stop a thread in Java, and therefore
 * no safe way to stop a task. There are only cooperative mechanisms, by which
 * the task and the code requesting cancellation follow an agreed-upon
 * protocol.
 *
 * One such cooperative mechanism is setting a "cancellation-request" flag
 * that the task checks periodically; if it finds the flag set, the task
 * terminates early.
 *
 * <NOTE_cancellation_policy>
 *
 *     A task that wants to be cancellable must have a cancellation policy
 *     that specifies the "how", "when", and "what" of cancellation - how
 *     other code can request cancellation, when the task checks whether
 *     cancellation has been requested, and what actions the task takes in
 *     response to a cancellation request.
 *
 *     PrimeGenerator uses simple cancellation policy: client code requests
 *     cancellation by calling "cancel", PrimeGenerator checks for cancellation
 *     once per prime found and exit when it detects cancellation has been requested.
 * </NOTE_cancellation_policy>
