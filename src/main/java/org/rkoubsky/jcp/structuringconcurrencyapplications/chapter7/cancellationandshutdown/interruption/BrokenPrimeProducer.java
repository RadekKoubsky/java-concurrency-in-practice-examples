/**
 * Unreliable cancellation that can leave producers stuck in a blocking operation. Don't do this.
 *
 * If a task that uses the same approach as PrimeGenerator (task exits after a while) calls
 * a bocking method such as BlockingQueue.put, we could have a more serious problem- the task
 * might never checks the cancellation flag and therefore might never terminate.
 *
 * BrokenPrimeProducer illustrates this problem. The producer thread generates primes
 * and places them on a blocking queue. If the producer gets ahead of consumer,
 * the queue will fill up and the "put" method will block.
