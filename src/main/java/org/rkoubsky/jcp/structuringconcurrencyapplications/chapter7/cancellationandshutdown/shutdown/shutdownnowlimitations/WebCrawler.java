/**
 * Using TrackingExecutorService to save unfinished tasks for later execution
 *
 * WebCrawler shows an application of link {@link TrackingExecutor}. The
 * work of a web crawler is often unbounded, so if a crawler must be shut down
 * we might want to save its state so it can be restarted later.
 *
 * CrawlTask provides a getPage method that identifies what page it is working on.
 * When the crawler is shut down, both tasks that did not start and those that
 * were cancelled are scanned and their URLs recorded, so tha page-crawling tasks
 * for those URLs can be added to the queue when the crawler restarts.
 *
 * <NOTE_unavoidable_race_condition>
 *
 *     TrackingExecutor has an unavoidable race condition that could make it
 *     yield false positives: tasks that are identified as cancelled but actually
 *     completed.
 *
 *     This arises because the thread pool could be shut down between when the last
 *     instruction of the task executes and when the pool records the task as complete.
 *
 *     This is not a problem if tasks are idempotent (if performing them twice has
 *     the same effect as performing once), as they typically are in a web crawler.
 *     Otherwise the application retrieving the cancelled tasks must be aware of the
 *     risk and be prepared to deal with false positives.
 *
 * </NOTE_unavoidable_race_condition>
