/**
 * Producer-consumer logging service with no shutdown support
 *
 * LogWriter shows a simple logging service in which the logging
 * activity is moved to a separate logger thread.
 *
 * For a service like LogWriter to be useful in production, we
 * need a way to terminate the logger thread so it does not prevent
 * the JVM from shutting down normally.
 *
 * However, simply making the logger thread exit is not very satisfying
 * shutdown mechanism. Such abrupt shutdown discards log messages that might
 * be waiting to be written to the log, but more importantly, threads blocked
 * in "log" because of full queue will never become unblocked.
 *
 * Cancelling producer-consumer activity requires cancelling both the producers
 * and the consumers. Interrupting the logger thread deals with the consumer,
 * but because the producers in this case are not dedicated threads, cancelling
 * them is harder.
 *
 * Unreliable way to add shutdown support to the logging service:
 *
 * public void log(final String msg) throws InterruptedException {
 *         if(!shutdownRequested){
 *             this.queue.put(msg);
 *         } else {
 *             throw new IllegalStateException("logger is shut down")
 *         }
 *     }
 *
 * The approach above has race conditions. The implementation of "log" is
 * check-then-act sequence: producers could observe that the service has not
 * yet been shutdown but still queue messages after shutdown, again with the
 * risk that producer might get blocked in "log" and never get unblocked.
 *
 * To fix the race condition means making the submission of a new log message
 * atomic, see the
