/**
 * Simple lock-ordering deadlock
 *
 * If one thread calls "leftRight" and another calls "rightLeft",
 * and their actions are interleaved, they will deadlock.
 *
 * The deadlock came about because the two threads attempted to
 * acquire the same locks in a different order.
 *
 * <NOTE_deadly_embrace>
 *
 *     When a thread A holds lock L and tries to acquire lock M,
 *     but at the same time thread B holds M and tries to acquire
 *     L, both threads will wait forever.
 *
 * </NOTE_deadly_embrace>
 *
 * <NOTE_lock_ordering_deadlock_free>
 *
 *     A program will be free of lock-ordering deadlocks if all
 *     threads acquire the locks they need in a fixed global order.
