/**
 * @NotThreadSafe
 *
 * <NOTE_number_of_servlet_instances>
 *
 * According to Servlet Specification 4.0, the servlet container must use only one instance per servlet declaration,
 * thus the servlet instance is shared across multiple threads and is expected to be thread safe.
 *
 * </NOTE_number_of_servlet_instances>
 *
 * This servlet is not threadsafe, it is susceptible to LOST UPDATES
 *
 * The increment operation ++count is not atomic, which means that it does not execute
 * as a single, indivisible operation.
 *
 * The ++count represents three operations: read the current value, add one to it, write the new value back
 *
 * The ++count operation is a READ-MODIFY-WRITE operation, in which the resulting state s derived from the
 * previous state. It must be atomic to ensure thread safety.
 *
 * <NOTE_race_condition>
 *
 * This servlet has several race conditions.
 *
 * A race condition occurs when the correctness of a computation depends on the relative timing
 * or interleaving of multiple threads by the runtime.
 *
 * Simply put: Getting the right answer relies on lucky timing.
 *
 * </NOTE_race_condition>
