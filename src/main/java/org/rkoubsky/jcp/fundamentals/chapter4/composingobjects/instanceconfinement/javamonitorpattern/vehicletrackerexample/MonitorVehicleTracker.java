/**
 * Monitor-based vehicle tracker implementation
 *
 * This class encapsulates the identity and locations of the known vehicles,
 * making them well-suited as a data model in a model-view-controller GUI
 * application where it might be shared by a view thread and multiple updater threads.
 *
 * Since the view thread and the updater threads will access the data model concurrently,
 * it must be thread-safe.
 *
 * <NOTE_mutable_point>
 *
 *     Even though MutablePoint is not thread-safe, the tracker class is.
 *     Neither the map nor any of the mutable points it contains is ever published.
 *     When we need to return vehicle locations to callers, the appropriate values
 *     are copied using either the MutablePoint copy constructor or deepCopy,
 *     which creates a new Map whose values are copies of the keys and values from
 *     the old Map.
 *
 * </NOTE_mutable_point>
 *
 * <NOTE_performance>
 *
 *     This implementation maintains thread safety in part by copying mutable data
 *     before returning it to the client. This is usually not a performance issue,
 *     but could become one if the set of vehicles is very large (holding the lock
 *     for the long-running copy operation could degrade the responsiveness of UI).
 *
 * </NOTE_performance>
