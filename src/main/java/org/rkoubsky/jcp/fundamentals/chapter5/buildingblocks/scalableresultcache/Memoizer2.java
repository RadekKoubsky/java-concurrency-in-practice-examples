/**
 * Replacing HashMap with ConcurrentHashMap
 *
 * Memoizer2 improves on the awful concurrent behavior of
 * Memoizer1 by replacing the HashMap with a ConcurrentHashMap.
 *
 * Since ConcurrentHashMap is thread-safe, there is no need to
 * synchronize when accessing the backing Map, thus eliminating
 * the serialization induced by synchronizing the "compute" method
 * in Memoizer1.
 *
 * Memoizer2 certainly has better concurrent behavior than Memoizer1:
 * multiple threads can use it concurrently.
 *
 * <NOTE_problem_of_computing_the_same_value_twice>
 *
 * But it still has some defects as a cache - there is a window of vulnerability in
 * which two threads calling the "compute" method at the same time could
 * end up computing the same value. In the case of memoization, this is
 * merely inefficient as the purpose of a cache is to prevent the same data
 * being calculated multiple times.
 *
 * For a more general-purpose caching mechanism, it is far worse;
 * for an object cache that is supposed to provide once-and-only-once
 * initialization, this vulnerability would also pose safety risk.
 *
 * Solution: We need a way for a thread to wait for a result of a computation,
 * the FutureTask class does exactly this.
