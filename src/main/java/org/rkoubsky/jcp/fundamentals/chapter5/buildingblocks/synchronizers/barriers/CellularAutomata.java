/**
 * Coordinating computation in a cellular automaton with CyclicBarrier
 *
 * <NOTE_barriers_vs_latches>
 *
 *     Barriers are similar to latches in that they block a group of
 *     threads until some event occurred. The key difference is that
 *     with a barrier, all the threads must come together at a barrier
 *     point at the same time in order to proceed.
 *
 *     Latches are for waiting for events.
 *
 *     Barriers are for waiting for other threads.
 *
 * </NOTE_barriers_vs_latches>
 *
 * This class demonstrates using a barrier to compute a cellular
 * automata simulation, such as Conway's Life game.
 *
 * Instead of assigning a separate thread to each element (in the case of Life, a cell) which
 * would require too many threads, it makes sense to partition the problem into a number
 * of subparts, let each thread solve a subpart, and then merge the result (after all threads
 * have reached the barrier).
