/**
 * Nonblocking stack using Treiber's algorithm
 *
 * ConcurrentStack shows how to construct a stack using atomic
 * references.
 *
 * The stack is a linked list of Node elements, rooted at the top,
 * each of which contains a value and a link to the next element.
 *
 * Nonblocking algorithms like ConcurrentStack derive their thread
 * safety from the fact that, like locking, "compareAndSet" provides
 * both atomicity and visibility guarantees.
 *
 * When a thread changes the state of the stack, it does so with a "compareAndSet",
 * which has the memory effects of a volatile write. When a thread examines
 * the stack, it does so bh calling "get" on the same AtomicReference,
 * which has the same effect as volatile reads.

     * try to install it on the top of the stack.
     *
     * If the same node is still on the top of the stack as when we
     * started, the CAS succeeds; if the top node has changed (because
     * other thread has added or removed elements since we started), the
     * CAS fails and "push" updates the new node based on the current state
     * and tries again. In either case, the stack is still in a consistent
     * state after the CAS.
