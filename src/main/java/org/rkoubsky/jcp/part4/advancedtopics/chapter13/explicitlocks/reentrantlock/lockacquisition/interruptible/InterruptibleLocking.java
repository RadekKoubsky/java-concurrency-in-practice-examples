 * InterruptibleLocking
 *
 * Just as timed lock acquisition allows exclusive locking to be used
 * within timed-limited activities, interruptible lock acquisition allows
 * locking to be used within cancellable activities.
 *
 * This class uSses "lockInterruptibly" to implement sendOnSharedLine from {@link TimedLocking} so
 * that we can call it from a cancellable task. The timed tryLock is also responsive to
 * interruption when you need both timed and interruptible lock acquisition.
